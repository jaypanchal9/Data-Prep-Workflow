# SpotlessData

SpotlessData is a structured repository for performing efficient data cleaning and preprocessing using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It includes tasks designed to simplify the process of preparing datasets for analysis by identifying and correcting issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

## Project Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks, each targeting specific aspects of data cleaning and preprocessing:

### Task 1: **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- **Purpose:** Advanced data cleaning and outlier detection and correction.
- **Key Components:**
  - Mounting Google Drive to access datasets.
  - Identification, analysis, and treatment of outliers.
  - Libraries utilized: `pandas`, `numpy`, and additional supporting libraries.

### Task 2: **Data Loading and Cleaning Workflow**
- **Purpose:** Fundamental data loading procedures and initial data cleaning.
- **Key Components:**
  - Mounting Google Drive for dataset loading.
  - Basic operations for cleaning datasets, including handling missing data.
  - Libraries utilized: `pandas`, `numpy`, and additional supporting libraries.
